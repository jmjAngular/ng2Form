###Simple example of FORM management in angular2
####Don't worry about lots of config file here... we can discuss it later
####Only think about package.json,systemjs.config.js,tsconfig.json,typings.json -> These all mentioned at https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html


## Install npm packages

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

**You must run all of these commands**.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> If the `typings` folder doesn't show up after `npm install` please install them manually with:

> `npm run typings -- install`
